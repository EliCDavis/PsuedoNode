# PseudoNode

This is an unfinished program!  
Check out what the project looks like currently over [here](http://www.jayusstudios.com/Projects/PseudoNode/).
Using the program requires you to log into github through it.  Once in you can load in one of your repositories and begin documenting and organizing it inside the program.

### Inspiration
It can be hard coming on to a project, especially one that has existed for years.

You can look through what documentation has been provided on the actual structure of the code, but your best bet is to just go poking around the folder structure and code to see what's there.  Generally, the more familiar you are about the present state of the project and where everything is located, the easier it is to work on it.

### What this aims to be

PseudoNode aims to be a project organization utility for providing more useful documentation and producing analytics for your project.  One way that it aims to be more helpful is by allowing users to define programming standards, such as naming conventions and design patterns in the project's settings. Another feature is to allow the user to define 'purposes' in every directory, and assign those purposes to different files inside the directory and sub-directories so you know why they are there.	

### Future
Here's a run-down of features I want to provide:

* ~~Generate graphs displaying data relating to recent commits and what is currentely being worked on.~~
* Parse user code to retrieve comments and defined methods to utilize to build relationships between classes for visualization.
* Generate statistics for seeing which users are working on different purposes in the program.
* Generate README.md files for every directory detailing the purposes they serve.
* Allow users to quickly define classes with methods and push them to the repository as templates to be filled out.
